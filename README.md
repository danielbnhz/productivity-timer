## A productivity app based on Python, currently under construction

The app is currently functional. After cloning, just run
```bash
    python main.py
```
This will be elaborated on as the program grows more elaborated

Current the app will write a database according to the tasks set in config.py
When you initiate the app. It will present you with a prompt to start a task
just click 'y' and it will begin, or 'n' to end the program.

The program will then prompt how many minutes you wish to work for. And then it
will ask for the category for the task. 

When finished, you can run sqlite3 commands on the database to gauge your productivity

the app will be elaborated to include database reading functions during runtime
